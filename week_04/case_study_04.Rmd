## Searching for the farest airport

First, sort the dataframe by distance. Here we use decensing order, so the first row represent the data with longest distance. Second, silce the first row. By slicing, we can minimize the calculation time in join process. Third, join "dest" in flights and "faa" in airports. Fouth, select the destination name. Finally, change the name from dataframe to charactor.

```{r}
farthest_airport <- flights %>%
  arrange(desc(distance)) %>%
  slice_head(n = 1) %>%
  left_join(airports, by = c("dest" = "faa")) %>%
  select(name) %>%
  as.character()

farthest_airport  
```
